# Proactive Safety System for Hazardous Openings

## Overview
The Proactive Safety System for Hazardous Openings is designed to enhance safety around hazardous areas such as manholes and potholes. This project utilizes multiple ultrasonic sensors to detect the proximity of objects or individuals to these dangerous openings. When a potential hazard is detected within a predefined distance threshold, the system triggers visual and auditory alerts, and deploys physical barriers using servo motors to prevent accidents. The system also includes password-based authentication for secure data access and uses Kalman filtering for accurate distance measurements.

## Hardware Requirements
- **Arduino Board:** Microcontroller platform for managing sensor inputs and outputs
- **Servo Motors (4):** To deploy physical barriers when a hazard is detected
- **Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04) (4):** For distance measurement and hazard detection
- **Buzzer:** To provide auditory alerts when a hazard is detected
- **Jumper Wires:** For connecting components
- **Red LED:** To provide visual alerts when a hazard is detected
- **Breadboard:** For prototyping and connecting components

## Software Requirements
- **Arduino IDE:** For programming the Arduino board
- **Tinkercad:** For simulating and testing the project
- **Servo.h Library:** For controlling the servo motors

## Flow of the Project
1. **Initialization:**
   - Set the threshold distance for safe proximity to hazardous openings.
   - Initialize the Arduino board, ultrasonic sensors, servo motors, buzzer, and LED.
2. **Password Authentication:**
   - Prompt the user for a password upon startup.
   - Allow further operation only if the password matches the predefined code.
3. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Measure distances using ultrasonic sensors.
   - Use Kalman filtering to ensure accurate distance readings.
4. **Hazard Detection:**
   - Compare the measured distance to the threshold.
   - If any sensor detects a distance less than the threshold, trigger alerts and deploy barriers.
5. **Alert and Response:**
   - Sound the buzzer and flash the red LED to alert individuals.
   - Activate all servo motors to deploy physical barriers.
6. **Reset and Monitor:**
   - Continuously monitor the environment and reset alerts and barriers once the hazard is no longer detected.

## Conclusion
The Proactive Safety System for Hazardous Openings provides a comprehensive solution to enhance safety in areas with potential hazards. By integrating ultrasonic sensors, servo motors, and alert systems, the project ensures real-time detection and response to prevent accidents. The use of password-based authentication and Kalman filtering further improves the system's security and accuracy. This project offers a scalable and adaptable approach to improving safety standards in various environments.
